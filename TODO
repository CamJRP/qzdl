Here's a short list of future features:

- Get IWAD Map names (questionable)
- Use MAP instead of -Warp
- Config file DMFlags
- Store IWAD map names in config files (ie m0n=E1M1)
- Global/local/user based configs
- A small preview of the map, read this from a screenshot directory
- Expand ~
- Implement the 'always add these args' to spec
