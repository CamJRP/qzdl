Bugs:
- Map field stored lower case
  - Not sure of issue here
- +Set does not appear to work
  <NeuralStunner> "+Set DeathMatch 1" will not start a game as DM (3.1a does)
  <NeuralStunner> +DeathMatch 1 works, however
  <NeuralStunner> Odd thing is, it uses +Set in the command line for the DMFlags
  - Not sure of issue here

Here's a short list of future features:
- Process command line arguments correctly
- Support zdl.general/zdllaunch
- Change show cmd line to ask for launch
- Get IWAD Map names (questionable)
- Config file DMFlags
- Store IWAD map names in config files (ie m0n=E1M1)
- Global/local/user based configs
- A small preview of the map, read this from a screenshot directory
- Expand ~
