Bugs:
- Map field stored lower case
- Fix complete replace of config on .ZDL load - replace without clearning current config
- <NeuralStunner> Okay. First off, for some reason ZDoom doesn't get to properly read AutoExec
  <NeuralStunner> Works fine with ZDL 3.1a, I'm thinking because it changes active directory to ZDoom's
  <Zbot> By the way, NeuralStunner on espernet told me "privmsg qbasicer that I found: ZDLSharp definitely needs to switch to the port's directory. Ran ChocoDoom with it, and it stored the configs in ZDL's directory." 17 minutes and 4 seconds ago
- +Set does not appear to work
  <NeuralStunner> "+Set DeathMatch 1" will not start a game as DM (3.1a does)
  <NeuralStunner> +DeathMatch 1 works, however
  <NeuralStunner> Odd thing is, it uses +Set in the command line for the DMFlags
- <NeuralStunner> When Remove is used on a file in the External Files list, it unselects everything in that box
  <NeuralStunner> Whereas in 1.3a it leaves the next file selected, so you can just hit Remove repeatedly and clear the list
- Exit button doesn't work - oops!


Here's a short list of future features:

- Get IWAD Map names (questionable)
- Use MAP instead of -Warp
- Config file DMFlags
- Store IWAD map names in config files (ie m0n=E1M1)
- Global/local/user based configs
- A small preview of the map, read this from a screenshot directory
- Expand ~
- Implement the 'always add these args' to spec
