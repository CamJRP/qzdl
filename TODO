Bugs:
- Map field stored lower case
- +Set does not appear to work
  <NeuralStunner> "+Set DeathMatch 1" will not start a game as DM (3.1a does)
  <NeuralStunner> +DeathMatch 1 works, however
  <NeuralStunner> Odd thing is, it uses +Set in the command line for the DMFlags
- <NeuralStunner> When Remove is used on a file in the External Files list, it unselects everything in that box
  <NeuralStunner> Whereas in 1.3a it leaves the next file selected, so you can just hit Remove repeatedly and clear the list


Here's a short list of future features:

- Get IWAD Map names (questionable)
- Config file DMFlags
- Store IWAD map names in config files (ie m0n=E1M1)
- Global/local/user based configs
- A small preview of the map, read this from a screenshot directory
- Expand ~
- Implement the 'always add these args' to spec
