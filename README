Thank you for trying ZDLSharp 3.0.5.3q alpha!
Without your help to 'alpha-test', this version
of ZDLSharp would never be released.

Special Thanks:
- Ryan "Biohazard" Turner, original ZDL artwork/designer/coder
- NeuralStunner, alpha tester and artwork
- Risen, Enjay, DRDTeam.org, ZDoom.org, for being awesome
